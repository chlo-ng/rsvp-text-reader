## Application Description
This application reads a user's selected text file and plays it back on screen as a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) text reader.
The user is able to select font, font size, words per minute (WPM), select the file to read, and a Play/Pause button for the reader. 

## Issues or Incompleted Requirements
- Centering of text to vertical line is not complete; the words do not align to the vertical line
    - Sometimes a word pops outside of the floatlayout that encases the label containing the word but then fixes itself at the next word
- No line under the baseline
- Words are all presented for the same duration with no regards to its length (no presentation function that is based on word length)
